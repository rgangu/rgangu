# Hi, I'm Rohit ðŸ‘‹
-------------------
I am a data scientist, with interests in NLP, statistical modeling, and computer vision.

Feel free to check out my repos - from projects I've done at hackathons, to experiments. Sorry, don't have too much work stuff here - for obvious confidentiality reasons. 

You can reach me at rbg5181 (AT) gmail (DOT) com.
